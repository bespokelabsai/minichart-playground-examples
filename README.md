### Examples for the MiniChart Playground

Bespoke-MiniChart-7B is an open‑source chart‑understanding Vision‑Language Model (VLM) developed at Bespoke Labs and maintained by Liyan Tang and Bespoke Labs. It sets a new state‑of‑the‑art in chart question‑answering (Chart‑QA) for 7 billion‑parameter models, outperforming much larger closed models such as Gemini‑1.5‑Pro and Claude‑3.5 on seven public benchmarks.
